# DatabaseDesign
Project: Multi-Specialty Ambulatory Health Center

The purpose of this project was to design an initial database schema for BUAHC which is a Multi-Specialty Ambulatory Health Center.

At a high-level, this design covered the following four use cases:
* Physician Schedules
* Patient Appointments/Visits with their Physicians
* Physician Waitlists for Patients
* Patient Insurance Plans
* Waitlist checker when a Physician Schedule Entry is added to the Schedule
* Appointment to Specialty reporting to help make budget decisions when a new Physician can be hired.
